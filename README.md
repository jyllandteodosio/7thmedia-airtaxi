## Plugins Installed and Plugin Status on this build ##
### Must-Use Plugin/s ###
1. **Website Specific Functions Plugin** - This plugin should hold all the functions to extend Wordpress core. This is to keep away on using the theme's function.php file if the contents and functionality not directly dependent on the Theme. This will make content integrity and compatibility better even when the user switched theme. 

**UPDATE:** Once WP-STARTER is installed, please go to "path/to/your/project/wp-content/mu-plugins/site-specific-functions.php". Please update this line `wp_redirect(get_bloginfo('home').'/trade-access');` to `wp_redirect(get_bloginfo('home').'/');`. This code is used to redirect to a custom URL once the user logged out. This is to ensure that, if the current site is hiding the WP-ADMIN url, the user is redirected back to a valid URL. If you don't change the WP-ADMIN URL, you can completely delete the entire hook.

### Standard Plugins ###
1. **Wordfence** - *Initially deactivated* Once WP Starter is installed, navigate to Plugins and Activate Wordfence, this will create it's table to the database. *Initial Status of this has been changed to deactivated to prevent database migration errors due to case-sensitive database table names.*  Please use this settings token to import previous setting: `e6598c917bb97794c380dc3392c1a6f7c220ddf29b8a36de4e1bbcc067fbf4010f3fe21b71602d033554da0ebb0c583c84a551297597d6de990eb2d1fcf6cf75`.

## Working with the Genesis Starter Theme ##
1. Please use the **Website Specific Functions Plugin** for Site specific function extends instead of the theme's functions.php file. If the you need to add function that is Theme specific, keep it on the functions.php file.
2. Do not edit Genesis Framework (Parent Theme)
3. Install a Genesis Child Theme or create a new one.
4. If website is custom but fits Genesis Framework, use the Sample Child Theme as base.
5. Change the theme name folder to the company/client name. 
6. Rename the theme name in style.css and functions.php to the name of the company/client.
7. For inserting new css and javascript files, you may add the source in functions.php by adding in the functions the wp_enqueue_style or wp_enqueue_script.
8. For customizing the look of an existing child theme, you may edit in style.css file.
9. To edit the function of the theme, edit functions.php file.



## What to keep in mind? ##
1. Please update the **WP-CONFIG.PHP** file database details. Update database name, database user and password that corresponds to your server settings. 
2. Please make sure that you use the initial database included on this Repository under ```db/genesis_starter_0.sql```. This SQL only contains table. Please create your own database on your server and import these tables on it. 
3. Once the installation is done, please update the Site Details like Site Name, Site Description under the Settings page on the WP Dashboard. 
4. If you might need to install it in a different directory other than using the default ```genesis-starter-0```, please take a look at your ```.htaccess``` file and update it. The default htaccess looks like this: 
```
# BEGIN WordPress
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /wp-starter-0/
RewriteRule ^index\.php$ - [L]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /wp-starter-0/index.php [L]
</IfModule>

# END WordPress

```
Replace the ``` wp-starter-0 ``` with your folder. On production server, RewriteBase is just ``` RewriteBase / ``` and RewriteRule is ``` /index.php [L] ```



##Your Project Specific Changes##

1. Do a Search and Replace for ``http://localhost/genesis-starter-0`` and change it to your current directory location for your localhost setup or if it is on a sub-domain, use your sudbdomain full url including http://.

2. Here is the default Admin Credentials for this build. Username: `@dm1n1str@t0r` and password: `jG*#D7Cot*@86!!$op`. **Please update the password immediately after the installation and import of database to make sure that your project is not using our generic password.** If needed, you may want to add a new admin user with full admin capability and defer using the default user. Default credential is meant only for accessing the dashboard for this WP Starter build.
